# Set Up MongoDb

Before running the backend, you need to configure your MongoDB Atlas cluster:

1. **Get the Connection String:**  
   - Your connection string should resemble:  
     ```
     mongodb+srv://VictoBuicaYorku:adrian@tempcluster.60vcy.mongodb.net/
     ```

## NOTE

Since we have a mongodb the database is actually located on aws or azure services hence why no physical database is located here.
